# Pod PV Demo

## Overview
Please find below some instructions on the coding assessment. 
As part of our discussion on Wednesday,
Both Andrew & I will be on the call
We'd like to use the first half to hear an overview of your solution, understand your approach/thought process, and ask follow-up questions.
We'll use the second half to do another live brain teaser.
If you can send over any material/code a bit ahead of time, that would be great, so we can arrive with prepared questions.

## Assessment guidelines
At Pod, our goal is to build a 1-stop productivity platform for Account Executives, so they can spend less time jumping/switching between sub-optimal tools and more time closing deals. One of our main features is "Pipeline View" (sometimes referred to as PV, internally). Your task is to create a PV table, using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.

### Features:
- A table, where each row is a Deal with attributes: Id, Name, Amount ($), Address, Contact Name
- Clicking on a Deal takes you to that Deal's details page
- Ascending/Descending sorting for the first 3 columns
- Adjustable # of entries per page
- Pagination
- Search


These are indicative guidelines and you should feel free to do more, make assumptions, etc. based on your
Feel free to ask us any clarifying questions as needed.
